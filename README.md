# gotmplfmt

Fmt Go HTML templates. There are no options. The indenting used is 4 spaces.

## TODO

* When to keep things on a single line?
* Some extra spacing to air it out a little?
* Keep newlines, from the original, but squash them?
* {{end}} is now printed, with knowing if it was {{- end -}} or something.
